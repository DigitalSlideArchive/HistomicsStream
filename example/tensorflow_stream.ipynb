It applies whether the numbers are supplied to histomics_stream or returned by histomics_stream.  However, if the `magnification_source` is not `exact` the `returned_magnification` may not equal the `target_magnification`; to get the number of pixels that is relevant for the `returned_magnification`, typically these numbers of pixels are multiplied by the ratio `returned_magnification / target_magnification`.  In particular, the *pixel size of the returned tiles* will be the requested size times this ratio."
