# tensorflow_reader

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a whole-slide image file reader for TensorFlow. This reader will allow users to extract pixel data from whole-slide image formats, and will support reading paradigms that are commonly used during training and inference.

## Installation for Python

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tensorflow_reader.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow_reader)

tensorflow_reader can be easily installed with Python wheels.  If you do not want the installation to be to your current Python environment, you should first create and activate a [Python virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to work in.  Then, run the following from the command-line:

```shell-script
pip install tensorflow_reader
```

Launch `python3`, import the tensorflow_reader package, and use it

```python
import tensorflow_reader as tfr
```
